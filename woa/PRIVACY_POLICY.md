# 📜 Privacy Policy for World of Afrika

Effective Date: November 7, 2025.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use the World of Afrika mobile application (the "App").

1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We are committed to protecting your personal information. Our App operates primarily as a digital product catalogue and lead generation tool. We only collect the necessary information required to facilitate an inquiry about a product and connect you with a sales representative to complete a purchase off the App.

2. Information We Collect

We collect information in two main ways: Information You Provide and Information Collected Automatically.

A. Information You Provide (Voluntarily)

This is the Personal Data we collect directly from you when you submit a Product Inquiry Form within the App. This information is necessary for us to contact you and help you make a purchase.

Contact Information:

First and Last Name

Email Address

Phone Number (Contact Information)

Inquiry Data: Information related to the specific product you are interested in (e.g., product name, SKU, price).

B. Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data)

When you access the App, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information sent by your device.

Log Data: Device IP address, device type, operating system version, mobile network information, and usage patterns within the App (e.g., pages viewed, time spent in the App, the date and time of your visit).

Analytics: We may use third-party tools (such as Google Analytics) to help us analyze and improve the performance of our App. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following specific purposes:

Lead Generation & Sales Outreach: To contact you directly via the email address or phone number you provided to discuss the product inquiry, confirm details, and finalize the purchase through our off-app sales channels.

Customer Support: To respond to your requests, questions, or concerns.

App Improvement: To monitor and analyze usage and activity trends to improve the App's functionality and user experience.

Legal Compliance: To comply with legal obligations and protect our legal rights.

4. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We only disclose your information in the following limited circumstances:

With Our Internal Sales Team: We share the Contact Information you provide with our dedicated sales and customer service staff solely for the purpose of completing your requested purchase.

With Service Providers: We may share data with third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting providers, email service providers, or analytics platforms. These providers are obligated to protect your data.

Legal Requirements: If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).

5. Data Security

We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any Personal Data we process. However, no electronic transmission or storage method is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, typically for the duration required to complete your purchase inquiry and maintain necessary business records, or until you request its deletion.

7. Your Data Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your Personal Data:

Right of Access: The right to request copies of the Personal Data we hold about you.

Right to Rectification: The right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete.

Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"): The right to request that we delete your Personal Data, under certain conditions.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 9.

Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from anyone under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
