# Privacy Policy for Backlogr

**Effective Date: August 30, 2025**

Backlogr ("we," "us," or "our") is a mobile application developed by Backlogr Devs, designed to help users manage and track their backlogs for tasks, games, or other activities. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

By downloading, installing, or using Backlogr (the "App"), you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve the App's features, such as backlog tracking, backups, and premium functionalities. The types of information we may collect include:

### a. Account and Authentication Information

- To enable certain features like data backups and synchronization, we may require you to create or link an account using third-party services (e.g., Google Account via Google Drive). This may include your email address, username, or other identifiers provided by the third-party service.
- We do not store your third-party login credentials; authentication is handled directly by the third-party provider.

### b. Subscription and Payment Information

- For premium or plus accounts, subscriptions are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store your payment details (e.g., credit card information). All billing is managed by Google Play, and we only receive confirmation of your subscription status.
- We may collect basic information related to your subscription, such as your Google Play account identifier, to verify and manage your premium access.

### c. Usage and Device Information

- Automatically collected data when you use the App, including device type, operating system, IP address, app version, and usage patterns (e.g., how you interact with backlog features).
- We may use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect anonymized data on app performance and user behavior to improve the App.

### d. User-Provided Content

- Any data you input into the App, such as backlog lists, notes, or preferences. This is stored locally on your device unless you enable backups via third-party services.

We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., health data, financial details beyond subscriptions, or biometric data) unless explicitly required for a feature and with your consent.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- To provide core App functionalities, such as creating and managing backlogs.
- To enable backups and data synchronization through third-party services like Google Drive.
- To process and manage premium subscriptions via Google Play.
- To improve the App, fix bugs, and analyze usage trends.
- To communicate with you, such as sending app updates or responding to support requests.
- To comply with legal obligations, enforce our terms, or protect our rights.

We do not use your information for targeted advertising or sell it to third parties.

## 3. Sharing Your Information

We may share your information in limited circumstances:

- **With Third-Party Services:** When you link a third-party account (e.g., Google Drive for backups), your data is shared with that provider as per their privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their terms (e.g., Google's Privacy Policy).
- **Service Providers:** We use trusted third-party providers for analytics, hosting, and billing (e.g., Google). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the services they provide to us.
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, subpoena, or government request, or to prevent harm, fraud, or illegal activities.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the new entity.

We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. Backups via third-party services are subject to their security practices.

Your backlog data is stored locally on your device by default. If you enable cloud backups, it is encrypted in transit and stored on the third-party service's servers.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain your information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Policy or as required by law. For example:

- Account data is kept while your account is active.
- Subscription data is retained for billing verification.
- Usage data may be anonymized and retained indefinitely for analytics.

You can request deletion of your data at any time (see Section 7).

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware of such collection, we will delete it promptly.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights under data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA):

- **Access and Correction:** Request a copy of your data or correct inaccuracies.
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your data (note: this may affect App functionality).
- **Opt-Out:** Disable analytics or unlink third-party accounts via App settings.
- **Consent Withdrawal:** Withdraw consent for data processing where applicable.

To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in Section 9. We may verify your identity before processing requests.

You can manage subscriptions through Google Play settings.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Backlogr Devs is based in Uganda, but we may use service providers located in other countries (e.g., the United States for Google services). By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your data to these locations, where privacy laws may differ. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes via the App or email. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.
